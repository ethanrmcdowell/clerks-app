# Clerk's App

An application for West Bloomfield Township's Clerk's Office to use for recording and reviewing data on township garage sales, meetings, and deeds.

## About This Project

My goal with this project was to update an old Microsoft Access application, giving Clerk staff an easier and more modern way of reviewing and updating crucial information. With this new version of the application, I worked closely with Clerk staff to add new features and data points.
